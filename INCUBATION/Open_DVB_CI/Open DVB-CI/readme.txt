I wrote this project during year 2005. 

At that time, I worked for a subsidiary of a big company. This 
subsidiary didn't gave us work because the Headquarters decided 
to close us. We became an R&D team with no work, but having to 
go to work _just to clock in, heat seats, and clock out_.
My colleagues and I were in this dire situation for one year. 

As an excercise, I proposed myself and a colleague of mine to 
develop part of the software Stack for the Common Interface 
(Implementation for EN 50221:1997). This was my first work in C++.

My colleague developed the session layer. This layer is not uploaded
to sourceforge. May be some day will be uploaded. 
I developed the transport layer.

After one year we were fired. This was the sad end for great R&D 
TV team, with deep skills in hardware and embedded software.

This software is just an experiment. Just some people knew about it. 
Was developed to help us to kill the boredom.

To give some usefulness to my software I decided today to upload it to 
sourceforge.

The software is written to be run in a Linux machine, but keeping the 
possibility to be ported to another environments. Linux machine served  
to test it.

The transport layer is finished, and running properly as a unit. The 
integration phase with a link layer and a session layer was not done.

To test it, you need to copy and compile it in a Linux machine, and 
run testmanager. 

Nowadays I left electronics. I'm involved in other projects. I forgot
deep details of this implementation, but if some help is needed, don't 
hesitate to mail me at jordi.escoda@gmail.com. I will try to help.
