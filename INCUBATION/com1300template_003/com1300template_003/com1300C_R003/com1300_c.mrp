NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:537 - The following Virtex Blockram(s) is/are being retargetted
   to Virtex2 Blockram(s). This will waste 75% of Virtex2 Blockram capacity. To
   obtain better utilization, Please re-run memory generator to retarget to
   Virtex2 Blockram modules:
   RAMB4_S8_S8 symbol "COMSCOPE_001_TRACE_1_CAPTURE_8_BIT_WORDS_001_RAMB_001"

   CARDBUS_001_IORW_C_001/RAMB16_S9_S9_002 is not connected.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:535 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargetted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "BUFG_001" (output signal=CLK_P),
   BUFG symbol "BUFG_002" (output signal=CLK_IO),
   BUFG symbol "BUFG_004" (output signal=CB_CARD_CCLKG),
   BUFGP symbol "UC_ALE_BUFGP" (output signal=UC_ALE_BUFGP),
   BUFGP symbol "UC_WRN_BUFGP" (output signal=UC_WRN_BUFGP)
INFO:DesignRules:547 - Blockcheck: To achieve optimal frequency synthesis
   performance with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp U_DCM001,
   consult the Virtex-II Interactive Data Sheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 140 block(s) removed
  22 block(s) optimized away
 150 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
